# zbw.ejpdf

A rather old package used within [Economics E-Journal](http://economics-ejournal). 
It enables PDF cover creation for articles. Note that this package cannot be
used independently. It contains some interfaces linking to the main E-Journal
package. You'll also need a FOP installation and some fonts.
